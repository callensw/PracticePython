# Character Input
## Exercise 1
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.
Extras:
* Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message
* Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines

name = input("Please enter your name: ") # Retrieves the user's name
age = int(input("Now enter your age: ")) # Retrieves the user's age
iterations = input("Now provide another number: ") # Retrieves another number
hundred_years = str(100 - age + 2019) # Calculates when the user will turn 100

for i in range(0, int(iterations)):
    print("Hello " + name + ", you will turn 100 years old in " + hundred_years)
