#Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) 
#and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. 
#For practice, write this code inside a function.

a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]

#Create function
def first_last(lst):
    return [lst[0],lst[-1]]
    
#Call function
print(first_last(a))
