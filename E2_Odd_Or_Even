# Odd Or Even

## Exercise 2
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?
### Extras:
* If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
* Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.
# Divisible by 4 message, even, or odd message
number = int(input("Please provide a number:"))
if number % 4 == 0:
    print("This number is divisible by 4!!!")
elif number % 2 == 0:
        print("This is an even number!")
else:
    print("This is an odd number...")
    
num = int(input("Please provide a number:"))
number = int(input("Please provide another number to divide by:"))

# Divisible by number provided
if num % number == 0:
    print("Yes! " + str(num) + " Is divisible by " + str(number))
else:
    print("Shucks! " + str(num) + " Is not divisible by " + str(number))
