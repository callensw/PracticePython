#Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words. 
#Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order. For example, say I type the string:
    #My name is Michele
    #Then I would see the string:
    #Michele is name My
    #shown back to me.
    
def rev_word():
    words = input('Please provide a string containing multiple words: ')
    return ' '.join(words.split()[::-1])
    
print(rev_word())
